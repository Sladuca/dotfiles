# Installation

To install, simply run `./setup.sh`. It will make backups of any files it might overwrite.

You may need to install the Fira Code Nerd Font from https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads. These dotfiles also include my alacritty config, which, of course, won't do anything if you don't use alacritty.
