# Installation

To install, simply run `./setup.sh`. It will make backups of any files it might overwrite.

You may need to install the Fira Code Nerd Font from https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads

## Yabai

If on mac, a yabai config straight-up yoinked from https://github.com/itaysharir/Dotfiles can be installed by running `yabai/setup.sh`. To use it, you'll have to go through the instructions at https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection since it requires doing some stuff that isn't really automatable.

## Copilot

To get copilot to work, you'll have to authenticate with github the first time around with `:Copilot setup` inside neovim.
